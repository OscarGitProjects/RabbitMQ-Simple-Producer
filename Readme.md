When i run this i have RabbitMQ running in a Docker container

You can get the docker image with this command
docker run -it --rm --name Rabbit1 -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3.10-management

Portnummer 5672 is where RabbitMQ is running

After you have installed the docker image for the first time you can remove --rm from the command
